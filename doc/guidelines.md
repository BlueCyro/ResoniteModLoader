## Is Modding Resonite Allowed?

Yes probably, pending an official [Mod & Plugin Policy]

## Is Modding Good for Resonite?

Modding is generally healthy for games as it allows users to try out features and tweaks on a deeper more integrated level before and enhance their experience before a feature could be officially integrated. This also allows players to refine feature requests and test out implementations ahead of time. 

### The Pros

- Quality of life improvements before they have an official implementation. 
- Niche tweaks that may only make sense for a small handful of users and may be unlikely to be implemented.
- Hardware support for both new and obscure devices
- Lets power users opt-in to 'warranty-voiding' tools or unsupported functionality. Sometimes a desired feature risks breaking in the future. But at the same time it can be very useful in the meanwhile.
- The classic "if you outlaw guns only outlaws will have guns" argument.
<!-- - Possible source of new developers. If you're hiring someone to program for Resonite... why not hire someone who's *already* programming for Resonite? -->

### The Cons

- Risk of abuse. The more control users have over the game the more damage they can potentially do.
- Risk of breakage. Users *should* be aware that mods void the warranty, but some people might complain in the wrong channels when mods break. And if things go very wrong there's potential for a mod to break an unmodified user over the network.
- Misdirection of effort. If mods create a problem the Resonite team has to step in and solve that's less time spent improving the game.
